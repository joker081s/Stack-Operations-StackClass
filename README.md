# Stack-Operations-myClass
This is just same as Stack-Operations but with some changes like in this project, I used a different class and called it Stack. Then I used that class to perform operation of push and pop. Make an instance of that class in the main method. I make the global variables to perform operations in Stack Class.

Note :
    But I didn't use the Stack java-in-built class to perform these operations.
